## Part B. Web Camera

**a. Compare `helloYou/server.js` and `IDD-Fa18-Lab7/pictureServer.js`. What elements had to be added or changed to enable the web camera? (Hint: It might be good to know that there is a UNIX command called `diff` that compares files.)**

## Part C. Make it your own

**a. Find, install, and try out a node-based library and try to incorporate into your lab. Document your successes and failures (totally okay!) for your writeup. This will help others in class figure out cool new tools and capabilities.**

The camera image was always blur/overexposed which limited the things I was hoping to do (apply image filters and show a set to the user to select from). 

Alternately, I was able to use Jimp plugin to write a text caption on top of image.
Also, using nodemailer, I was able to mail the final poster to the user.


**b. Upload a video of your working modified project**
